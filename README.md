Manage Multiple Wordpress Installations Using Localhost

When developing Wordpress on your laptop or macbook using Xampp, Wamp or mamp it is difficult to manage 
more than one project without having to edit files. WP Shepherd lets you download and install as many
copies of Wordpress as you like and develop them all through a web gui.

Let me know what you think. Comments always welcome and suggestions will be greatly received.

Enjoy
